# Refactoring Accesibility

## Description
Accessibility is a very important aspect of web programming. It allows everyone to access the website features with no problems. 
The marketing company which owns the site wants to make the website more accessible to comply with  WCAG 2.1 AAA requirements. 
To achive this I changed the structure of the web site html using only the semantic elements and simplifiying the code as much as possible. 
This will also help the websites search engine ranking in a positive way.


## Usage

The website now can be used with the accessiblity tools.
I have tested the website for accesibility requirements and it passed with 0 errors.
